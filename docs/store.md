Once rolled the extension will use a physics simulation to determine the results of the roll.

**Real-Time Syncing**

The dice roller will sync this simulation over the network so all connected players can see the roll in real-time.

By default other players dice trays will show up as a small preview in the bottom right. You can expand this preview by clicking it.

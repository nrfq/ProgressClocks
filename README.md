## Usage
The GM can create custom progress clocks from the extension action menu. This allows you to set between
2 and 12 segments on the clock. These are not meant to be generic trackers, so if you need more than 12 steps,
reconsider whether a progress clock is right for the job!

The number of segments can be set with the slider, and the progress can be set by clicking on one of the segments.
Click on the same segment to reset the clock back to 0.

Visibility controls are available at the clock and panel level. For example, the GM might have three clocks, but only
two are visible to the player.
